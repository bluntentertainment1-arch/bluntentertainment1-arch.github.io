<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Device Tuner Pro 26</strong></p>
<p><em>Last updated: 28 December 2025</em></p>

<p>
Device Tuner Pro 26 ("the App") provides system information, battery usage insights,
photo management tools, and quick access to device settings. We value your privacy
and are committed to transparency about how the App works and how data is handled.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>a) Personal Information</h3>
<p>
The App does <strong>not collect, store, or require personal information</strong>
such as name, email address, phone number, contacts, or precise location.
</p>

<h3>b) Device & Usage Information</h3>
<p>
The App may access system-provided information including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Battery level and usage statistics</li>
    <li>Running or background app information (as provided by the operating system)</li>
    <li>Storage and media information related to photos selected by the user</li>
</ul>
<p>
This information is processed locally on the device and is not transmitted to
our own servers.
</p>

<h2>2. How the App Works</h2>

<h3>Battery Monitoring</h3>
<p>
The App displays battery information provided by the operating system. It may
offer tips and shortcuts to system settings. The App does not automatically
modify system power behavior.
</p>

<h3>Game Mode</h3>
<p>
Game Mode provides a focused user experience by displaying usage information and
offering quick access to relevant device settings. The App does not overclock
hardware or modify system performance beyond user-initiated actions.
</p>

<h3>Photo Cleanup</h3>
<p>
Photo Cleanup allows users to view and manually select photos for deletion.
All deletions require explicit user confirmation.
</p>

<h2>3. Permissions</h2>
<p>
The App requests permissions only when necessary:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Media / Storage Access</strong> – To display user-selected photos</li>
    <li><strong>Network Access</strong> – To support ads and basic app functionality</li>
    <li><strong>System Settings Access</strong> – To open system settings when requested</li>
</ul>
<p>
Permissions can be revoked at any time through your device settings.
</p>

<h2>4. Advertising & Third-Party Services</h2>

Device Tuner Pro 26 uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements,
including banner ads, interstitial ads, and rewarded ads.
</p>
<p>
AdMob may collect and process information such as device identifiers, IP address,

by trusted third-party service providers such as Google AdMob solely for
advertising and related services.
