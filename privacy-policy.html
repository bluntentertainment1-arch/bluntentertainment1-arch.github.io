<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><em>Last updated: 28 December 2025</em></p>

<p>
Device Tuner Pro 26 ("the App") is designed to provide users with system
information, battery usage insights, photo management tools, and quick access
to device settings. We value your privacy and are committed to transparency
regarding how the App works and how data is handled.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
